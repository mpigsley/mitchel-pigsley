        When at last, I woke, ancient tapestries of war weaved with crimson
        adorned the unfamiliar stone walls. The beggared trappings of the room
        sang of sacred morality found only in the hymns of old. At once, I knew
        this establishment as that of the spiritual, the holy, and the
        phantasmally divine. What I was doing here was puzzling, for as I
        attempted to recall prior events, I uncovered only a rising cloud of
        looming uncertainty. Scars spanned the length of my torso pointed toward
        an overwhelming and even profound type of trauma. A restrained panic
        verging upon hysteria forced my mind away from such matters as I began
        to recover.

        I spoke not but a few sentences while at the monastery, and the cadre
        came to address me as Nyandak. Believing it to be a patronymic
        assignment, I graciously accepted this moniker. Although I knew not why,
        it seemed to hold a level of privilege or regality in the abbey. Menial
        tasks such as gardening and tidying up the great hall helped fill the
        vacant places of my mind. This quaint, coastal village of Rosehelm
        became home to me for a time, although an impending suggestion of
        inscrutable doom settled languidly over me.

        One evening as the candles burned through the last of their waxen
        reservoirs and the shadows stretched ominously forth, I could take it no
        longer and asked the grim question. In hushed tones, the grandmaster
        abbot recounted the night of my admittance at this same monastery. It
        was a night most foul, as he explained it. A mist hung heavy in the
        abnormally chilly evening hours when the shrieks of men echoed from deep
        within Lashclaw Wood. The grand monastery door was barred shut as a
        posse of wary townspeople led by the constable assembled to face the
        unknown menace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking the narrative for a time, the abbot revealed that a once-beaten
        path wound its way through this woodland. It led directly to the nearby
        city-state known as Hemsbury. Relations had degraded as resentment rose
        over time until even the mention of the name could provoke a sneer. To
        this end, torches were fetched in the exploration of this dense wood
        along with a dizzying array of pitch-forks, scythes, clubs, and even a
        variety of grotesque household implements.

        They dared not fully reveal what they found in that barbarous
        timberland, but to say that many turned to flee at once while others of
        a more resolute nature set immediately to retching. Those that remained
        discovered me there in that noisome grove among the hacked bodies of
        dignitaries and ministers of a more refined order. The delegation of
        Hemsbury had met an accursed end as was just and right in the minds of
        the peoples of Rosehelm. Of that night, nothing more was spoken. The
        quiet, simple lives of the coastal hamlet went on.
      </p>
      <p>
        For days afterward, I worried of another mob as occurred that diabolical
        night, yielded by the fear that I was one from among those cadaverous
        foreigners. It seemed all too convenient that I might have memory loss
        and, therefore, not identify myself as from one nation or another. That
        cataclysmic sense of doom continued its dogged growth spurred on by this
        knowledge until one ghastly night, it burst forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wails echoed through the perverse abbey, followed by the inhuman,
        polyphonic exhalations of one possessed. Abbesses and clerics of the
        pontifical order restrained me, all the while chanting devilish runes in
        a harsh and sustained melody. The fear subsided as consciousness took
        hold once more, slamming me back into carnal reality. I was left feeble
        from the effort, but with a clear depiction of a terrible storm crashing
        over a narrow islet. A breathtaking monument rose above the waves there,
        jagged and imposing. High above, a menacing light filtered through a
        latticework of obsidian. It gashed open the souls of all who had lost
        their way, leaving something subhuman. Something damnably malignant.
        Something entirely not of this world. A disquieting wonderment and eerie
        foreboding replaced the infinitesimal doom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly six months to the day I woke, I left that hellish place of
        worship in search of the structure imprinted upon my mind.
