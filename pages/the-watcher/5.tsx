        I became an avatar of enmity sitting in the tranquility of that grove. I
        saw into the histories as men charged forth in choreographed order and
        battalions overtook one another. The fields of the dead and dying,
        decomposing in the dim light of a blood-red moon, brought me a perverse
        pleasure. Projecting forward, I saw weapons of immense and beautiful
        power unleashed upon their populations. Nature unrectifiably destroyed,
        obliteration after obliteration toward a desolation that has been
        foretold. Cosmic stability must be satisfied. I must be satisfied.

        Rising, I made my way through the dense foliage to an overgrown trail
        that twisted into the woodland. A pair of crows watched me from a
        gnarled branch, their onyx eyes revealing a connected understanding. I
        passed beneath them, fists clenching rapidly, then releasing indolently.
        Halting midstep, I listened to the wind permeating the misty wood.
        Voices reverberated in the distance as an unmistakable laugh rose among
        the chorus.

        The camp smelled of venison as a fire blazed heartily around a broken
        circle of animal hide tents. Men and women in silvered armor and crimson
        cloaks mingled about the grove. Grand stories of mirthful times
        intermixed with the hope of alliances to be made. It was all a
        lighthearted precursor to the impending savagery. Gazing down into
        vacant hands, obsidian hatchets appeared, their latticework emerging
        from my palms. I strode forth to the camp periphery, the chill of the
        night following my step.

        It took a surprisingly diminutive amount of force to cleave the first in
        half, a scream barely escaping their lips. In moments the wooded
        undergrowth became a confusion of cries for help and calls to arms. One
        after another charged me as I severed limb from limb, making my
        unrelenting way to the camp&quot;s heart. Scarlet spray misted the tent
        canvases, deciduous leaves, and brambled vegetation. Battles from across
        history flashed through my subconscious, movements and stances stolen
        from the most inimitable of champions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battle diminished as a macabre silence settled, broken only by the
        steady drip of blood into the growing pools. The axes dissipated as I
        fell to my knees, my vision swimming in that damnable arterial haze.
        Balance restored in the sacrifice of blood. Countless wounds reknit
        themselves with the last reserves of supernatural power. Unconsciously I
        fell amongst the bodies of the silvered dignitaries of Hemsbury.
