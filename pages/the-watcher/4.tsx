        Briney waters crashed over me as I startled awake. Inhaling the salty
        spindrift, I turned to hack up the sea into the whirling spume. The
        cerulean surf ebbed, revealing scorched sands beneath. Barbed obsidian
        cliffs rose menacingly from the island&quot;s bank, merging indistinctly
        into the structure&quot;s base that ascended toward the heavens. In the
        crimson dusk light, a halo of cirrus clouds circled high above. Divine
        imagery infected and twisted into the gates of hades and the damnable
        hellfire beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Painstakingly, I made my way up the escarpment and finally to the tower
        entrance. An incomprehensible grinding began as if tectonic plates were
        being pushed aside to reveal the absolute origin of all madness. An
        arterial haze encroached on my vision as I was pulled through the portal
        into the gloom beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        At what I believed to be the structure&quot;s center, a raised dais
        adorned with peculiar symbols unceasingly transposed themselves into an
        interlocking design. A central shaft rose up to the obscured apex that,
        all the while, beckoned me forth. In this occultic sanctum, I sensed a
        heaving, a forced inhalation and gradual exhalation. Of all the
        countless epochs this malicious divinity has existed, a final,
        unalterable necrosis had taken hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seismic grinding increased sharply as a beam of achromatic light
        erupted vertically from the platform. I felt a pull deep within my torso
        that elevated me toward that distant apogee. My consciousness ruptured
        and could no longer attach itself to my corporeal form. I glimpsed five
        pentagonally placed pillars from this nightmarish void that I understood
        as the cornerstones of reality. There I saw the watcher and the tower,
        an ancient, godlike duality that guarded this realm of
        nondimensionality. Chaos undulated like a raging sea between the
        pillars, kept in check by the cosmic forces and the keeper. Suddenly, a
        deafening and discordant note rung out as one of the five cracked, beams
        of radiating energy spewing out in all directions. Succumbing to the
        chaos, it dissolved into the roiling devastation, the four remaining
        columns shifting under the weight of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human memories, since the dawn of the great cataclysm, began filtering
        through my consciousness. There I saw cultural progress counterbalanced
        under the reprehensible weight of war. In the weave of the primordial
        chaos was found reticulating stability. It was exquisite in its design,
        but I began to observe a growing inclination towards pacification in
        men&quot;s minds. The new cycle decaying and inherently flawed, with no
        balance to be found. A twisted product of distilled disillusionment that
        must be rectified at all costs.
