        A cyclonic rainstorm hit the coast that very evening, delaying further
        action until it subsided. I stayed with the family during the
        postponement, helping as I could around the ramshackle shelter and
        dilapidated village. I sensed a concealed apprehension edging on abject
        hysteria in the townspeople, young and old. It was troublesome to
        ascertain if it was but a result of the dreadful weather or something
        more profound. Something more sinister.

        On many occasions, I observed deranged behaviors in the listless
        townsfolk. For instance, an emaciated young girl braved the typhoon one
        morning with an earthen vessel then proceeded to fill it in the ocean.
        Taking it up on shore, she threw it into a cask already brimming with
        rainwater. For the entirety of the forenoon, she repeated this inane
        task with an exacting step. I believed it to be a trance of an
        incomprehensible sort, or a malevolent curse on this child or her
        family. The revulsion consumed me as I noted other such vacuous acts
        during my time there.

        After an entire week, it was with elation that the angler readied his
        coracle for the final leg of my pilgrimage. We set off at dawn, hoping
        to catch a period of tranquility in the raging waters. As the listing
        raft fought the turbulence under the practiced hand of the angler, I
        dared ask him questions of a more personal sort. With astonishment, he
        revealed himself as a citizen of Hemsbury for which I thought
        unimaginable this far north. With a measure of trepidation, I began to
        inquire about the relations between his city-state and that of Rosehelm.
        War, as it turned out, is all that has ever been known, but rumors of
        reconciliation have traveled fast. On the subject, no more was
        disclosed, and we lapsed into a dismal silence.

        That evening I found little rest even as the storm abated, so I resigned
        myself to staring out across the waters. Abruptly and violently, I
        snapped back into that reverie. An opalescent veil cast itself across
        the seas, and with growing certainty, I envisioned a rising multitude of
        lifeless, amber eyesâ€”a fallen god. An ancient specter buried deep within
        the mists ever-converging, ever-learning, and ever-watching. It goaded
        me forward, ushering me into and past the gates of a forbidden
        underworld. In that aphotic expanse, faint strands of centralized energy
        pulled inward what I believed to be pieces of my own reality. Within
        that vacuum of time, I could observe the atomicity in the fundamental
        units of consciousness. In the convulsions of expended energy, I
        witnessed fractals resolving into incalculable patterns. Life, death,
        and the emptiness that existed before all merged in a shuttering
        instant.

        The coracle pitched wildly as the tie was severed. A blood-red moon
        framed and further emphasized by thin wisps of vapor hung imposingly
        above me. An icy wind buffeted the boat as the ocean swelled. The
        angler, above the surging chaos, called to me, yelling, &quot;Nyandak,
        traveler god of Esneros, save us. Save us all.&quot; This anthem recited
        continually under a crescendo of mayhem, incited a perverse and vile
        panic that rose like the waves. The angler&apos;s despairing pupils
        inflated sickeningly until only soot-black reservoirs stared back. A
        whitecapped surge overtook the small vessel, plunging us into the frigid
        depths. Before our gaze was broken, I swore to have seen those obsidian
        eyes crack, revealing infernal amber orbs beneath.
