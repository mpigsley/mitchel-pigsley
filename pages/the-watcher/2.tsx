        The air carried a craterous malevolence over the town of Rosehelm
        situated at the base of the monastery&apos;s bluff. There I found an old
        trawler who rasped of harsh, craggy waters to the north where great
        storms raged tirelessly. Between the coughing fits and slurred speech, I
        made out a dire warning of evil lurking deep within the seas and of a
        pollution laced with loathsome persuasions. So it was, with a sense of
        morbidity and of growing eldritch horror, this direction that I made my
        way along the battered coast.

        Although the expedition yielded little in the way of company, I often
        would come across the stray vagrant or roaming gypsy. Their ramblings,
        meaningless, and often hostile, helped to ease the dread of isolation.
        One such individual stole the entirety of my rations one fateful
        evening, but with luck, I found a small fishing community within a
        manageable distance. There I met a weathered beldame that, through
        considerable enticement, traded me further rations for stories of
        Rosehelm and all too specific information regarding its inhabitants. The
        cold calculation behind the soot-black eyes unnerved me as I left
        posthaste, peering over my shoulder at regular intervals in nameless
        horror.

        I found infrequent shelter in the shadow of large outcroppings
        overlooking the swell of the preternatural sea. In the dead of night, a
        slight luminosity or opalescence would reveal itself in the waters
        exposing the veil of surface tension and the queerious depths below. To
        define it as supernatural would be too simple a term for so vast a
        phenomenon. Regardless, I found safety and solace in the shelter of
        those stagnant, metamorphic stone structures that remained even under
        the onslaught of that oceanic gulf.

        One dismal night, during a period of fitful rest, a mesmeric vision
        penetrated my dreams. A vast, shadowy intelligence crossed a distended
        blood-red moon. Touching down in a tremendous black gulf, an immense
        tidal force rippled out to cover the planet&apos;s surface. As the
        purging wave resided, I sensed a rending, a definitive scission, of the
        celestial mind. In a distant flash of searing light, one division fell
        into the oceanic depths, the other solidifying as a monument on the new
        earthen surface. The seeds of creation mingled with the eldritch
        force&apos;s escalation until a new, unique building block of life
        sprung forth. For millenniums these two forces, occasionally adjusting
        but primarily watching, decayed until direct alterations became all but
        impossible. It was a slow death, a gradual slip into senescence. For
        once, I woke peacefully, the sound of the waves crashing against the
        extrusion of rock.

        It was another week before I found a decrepit village on the northern
        edge of civilization. There I met a septuagenarian angler that
        periodically braved the stormy waters to feed the lowly town. I
        introduced myself as Nyandak and observed a restrained sense of alarm in
        the elderly man. I asked trepidly of a relic, black as char, arising out
        of the tempestuous waves and of a demonic and piercing light. He became
        immediately reticent but offered a slight nod after only a spell. I must
        profess that being vindicated in this way was immobilizing and
        immediately asked after specifics. The angler, declining to answer,
        suggested ferrying me toward that distant isle. I agreed to the proposal
        straightaway.
